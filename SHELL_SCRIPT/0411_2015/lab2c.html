<h3>TITLE: </h3>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;"> LAB 2c</span> Using
Command Line FTP </blockquote>
<h3>OBJECTIVE: </h3>
<blockquote> As a result of this lab the student should be able to
transfering files using command line FTP. </blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>PART I</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Right click on the following link and select "Save target
as..." <br>
      <a href="vilabs.tar.gz">vi Lab Files</a></li>
    <li>Save the file to the C:\TEMP folder </li>
    <li>Open a Windows Command Prompt window and make C:\ your current
working directory.</li>
    <li>Start the FTP client by typing FTP and the pressing Enter. You
should see a prompt that looks like this:<br>
ftp&gt;</li>
    <li>You now need to open a connection to matrix.senecac.on.ca by
typing: <br>
      <b>open matrix.senecac.on.ca</b><br>
at the ftp&gt; prompt.</li>
    <li>Enter your matrix account name and password when prompted.</li>
    <li>Enter the command pwd and view the result. Where does it say
you are? ___________________________________________</li>
    <li>Enter the command ls and view the result. Where do you think
you are? ____________________________________________</li>
    <li>On the remote server change directories to the Labs directory
using the command <b>cd Labs</b></li>
    <li>Create a new directory on the remote computer by using the
command <b>mkdir vilabs</b></li>
    <li>On the remote server change directories to the vilabs directory
using the command <b>cd vilabs</b></li>
    <li>On the local computer change directories to the TEMP directory
by using the command <b>lcd TEMP</b></li>
    <li>The file we are transfering is a compressed archive file and
not just text. We should transfer this file using Binary mode.</li>
    <li>The default transfer mode is ASCII. Switch to Binary by using
the command <b>binary</b> </li>
    <li>Transfer the file to the remote server by using the command <b>put
vilabs.tar.gz</b></li>
    <li>What transfer mode was used to transfer the file?
________________________________________________</li>
    <li>How would you verify that the file had been transferred?
__________________________________________</li>
    <li>Close the connection by using the command <b>close</b></li>
    <li>Exit the FTP client by using the command <b>quit</b></li>
  </ol>
You have now successfully transfered a file to the matrix server.<br>
  <br>
Open a terminal window connection to matrix and login using your account<br>
Locate the file you just transfered. Change to the directory where it
is stored.<br>
We are going to extract the files from the compressed archive using the
tar utility. (More on this utility later)<br>
Execute the following command: <b>tar xvzf vilabs.tar.gz</b><br>
  <br>
What files were extracted from the archive?<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
Remove the archive file by executing the command <b>rm vilabs.tar.gz</b><br>
Now we can practise transfering files fom matrix to our local hard
drive.<br>
  <ol>
    <li>Open an FTP connection to matrix again and change to the
correct directories.</li>
    <li>The files we are transfering now are ASCII text files. So we
should make sure we transfer them in ASCII mode by using the command <b>ascii&gt;</b></li>
    <li>This time instead of "putting" the files on the server we are
"getting" the files from the server.</li>
    <li>Enter the command <b>get 1basics</b>. How many files were
transfered? _______________</li>
    <li>If we want to transfer multiple files at once we need to use
command <b>mget *</b> This will transfer all files from the current
remote directory.</li>
    <li>You will need to confirm the transfer of each file by typing <b>y</b>
enter.</li>
    <li>Try transfering multiple files to matrix using the <b>mput</b>
command.</li>
    <li>Close the connection and quit ftp</li>
  </ol>
  <b>Command line FTP is a very handy skill to have and it is worth
practising occasionally!!</b><br>
  <br>
Try using ftp to transfer files back and forth between phobos and
matrix.<br>
