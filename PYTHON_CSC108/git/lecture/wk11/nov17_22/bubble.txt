This trace was obtained by printing the list after every major pass of 
bubble sort (outer loop)

original list: [7, 4, -1, 9, 3, 6, 42]
[4, -1, 7, 3, 6, 9, 42]
[-1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 9, 42]
[-1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 42]
[-1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 42]
[-1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 42]
[-1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 42]
[-1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 42]

And this much larger trace was obtained by printing the list after every swap
(every inner loop operation):

original list: [7, 4, -1, 9, 3, 6, 42]
[4, 7, -1, 9, 3, 6, 42]
[4, -1, 7, 9, 3, 6, 42]
[4, -1, 7, 9, 3, 6, 42]
[4, -1, 7, 3, 9, 6, 42]
[4, -1, 7, 3, 6, 9, 42]
[4, -1, 7, 3, 6, 9, 42]
[-1, 4, 7, 3, 6, 9, 42]
[-1, 4, 7, 3, 6, 9, 42]
[-1, 4, 3, 7, 6, 9, 42]
[-1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 9, 42]
[-1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 9, 42]
[-1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 9, 42]
[-1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 42]
[-1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 42]
[-1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 42]
[-1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 42]
[-1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 42]
[-1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 42]
[-1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 42]
[-1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 42]
[-1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 42]
