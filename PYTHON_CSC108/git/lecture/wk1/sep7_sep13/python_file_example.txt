# What happens if we create a file that contains the code we typed in the console?

2
m = 5
x = 2
b = 2
y = m * x + b

# Nothing printed! The console is great for experimenting and getting quick answers,
# but if you want to run code multiple times, you should save it in a file and run
# the file. However, we then have to think about how to display the results of our 
# code. The "print" function will come in handy. To see what it does, uncomment 
# (remove the "#" from) the line below and then run your program again.

# print(y)
