# Here is our first example of a program.
# Remember:
#    1. First, decide what the function needs to do. Write a few examples.
#    2. Describe the what function needs (a number, in this case) and what
#       it will produce (another number)
#    3. Describe the function in English.
#    4. Finally, write the code for the function. Use "return" to send a 
#       value back to the location the function was called.

def double(number):
	''' (number) -> number
	Return the number given doubled.
	>>> double(2)
	4
	>>> double(3.6)
	7.2
	'''
	return number * 2
	
	
print("Doubling 4:", double(4))
x = 3
print("Doubling x (and x is 3):", double(x))
print("Doubling 3.6:", double(3.6))
print("About to call double without an argument")
double()
